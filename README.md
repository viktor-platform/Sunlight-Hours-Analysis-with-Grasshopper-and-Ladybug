# Sunlight-Hours-Analysis-with-Grasshopper-and-Ladybug
A VIKTOR sample app which parametrically designs a tower and runs a Ladybug sunhours analysis. ü¶óüêû

**Functionality**

This version of the app connect to a Rhino Compute Server
to design a  twisting tower, configured through the app parameters. With a toggle button you can run the sun hours analysis and visualize sun path dome

Each time the user updates a parameter, the Grasshopper script runs on
Rhino Compute server that builds the geometry and performs a sunhours analysis using Ladybug.
